# AnxietyAnalyser
A visualisation tool built using OpenFrameworks as part of my Final Year Project.

The project uses an Arduino with a heart rate sensor to provide a reading of the users heart rate, which is then displayed on screen as a visualisation.

Small snippets of code have been provided by helpful contributors from the OpenFrameworks forums. You should go see if you can contribute to it here: https://forum.openframeworks.cc/
