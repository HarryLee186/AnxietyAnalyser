# AnxietyAnalyser
A visualisation tool built using OpenFrameworks as part of my Final Year Project.

The project uses an Arduino with a heart rate sensor to provide a reading of the users heart rate, which is then displayed on screen as a visualisation.

Small snippets of code have been provided by helpful contributors from the OpenFrameworks forums. You should go see if you can contribute to it here: https://forum.openframeworks.cc/


PulseSensorPlayground provided the code used in the Interrupt.ino file as part of their library as well as small snippets in the AnxietyAnalyser.ino file. This was to enable the heart rate sensor to provide accurate readings. You can see their website here: https://pulsesensor.com/
